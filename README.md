# ACE-Prebuilt-Creature-Dynamics

A collection of yet to be built creatures for ACE with auto populated data from PCAP collections and generic templates via scripting.

Using files from:

https://github.com/ACEmulator/ACE-PCAP-Dynamics-Exports (Thanks Ripley!)

And removing existing creatures already completed in

# Effort

The goal is to cut down on monotonous copy and pasting by pre-building with generic templated values and pulling from PCAPs as much as possible.

Using these as a launch point and coupled with other tools is highly recommended.

Thanks for taking care of the heavy Python lift!

Huge thanks to those that got the data to the point it could be manipulated this way.
